Link shortener API, created with Spring Boot. Features entity expiration removal, adjustable with a cron schelude.



## Technologies used
Java 17

Backend - Spring Boot

Database - PostgreSQL

Testing - JUnit 5, Mockito

Other - Project Lombok, Springdoc, Jackson

## Documentation
By default, documentation on the endpoints will be available on /swagger-ui/index.html.
* You can disable this in application properties with ```springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false```

You can also see documentation on this page:
https://casperr04.github.io/link-shortener-spring/index.html

## Getting Started
Link shortener is a Spring Boot application built using Maven.

Firstly, you will need to set up PostgreSQL, which can be downloaded from here.
https://www.postgresql.org/download/ 

* Create a database created link-shortener
* In /src/main/resources, change the application.properties:
```
...
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/link-shortener
...
spring.datasource.username=[YOUR USERNAME]
spring.datasource.password=[YOUR PASSWORD]
...
```

* You can also create a seperate application.properties file and set those fields with the packaged jar.

You also need the Java 17 SDK.

## Running the API
You can run the application directly with
```
mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Or by packaging it and running it as a jar.
```
mvnw package
java -jar link-shortener-1.0.0.jar
```

## Endpoints
The API is pretty simple, with two endpoints. The first one will let you create a redirect URL, given an original link, on ```/link``` 
```
{
  "link": "examplelink.com"
}
```

If the URL is valid, you will get a response, like this:
```
{
  "link": "localhost8080/liAfG452k",
  "expirationDate": "2023-03-29T18:59:11.541Z"
}
```

The link will automatically redirect to the original URL, although it will be removed after the expiration date, which can be configured.

## Configuration
You can configure the expiration date of each link in application.properties.
```
link_expiry_days=[DAYS]
link_expiry_hours=[HOURS]
link_expiry_minutes=[MINUTES]
```
The application follows a schelude, in which it will remove all expired links.

By default, it is every 30 minutes, although this can be changed in the application.properties, using cron. 

Here is an example, with a scheluded removal every 30 minutes.
```
cron_expiration_date=0 0/30 * * * ?
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```
mvnw test
```


## Issues and feedback
Given this is my first Spring project, it is very likely that there are issues.
